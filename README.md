# Knight's Tour Algorithm

This project implements the **Knight's Tour** problem â€” a classic chess-based algorithmic challenge.  
The goal is to find a sequence of moves for a knight to visit every square on a chessboard exactly once.

## Description
The program explores all possible moves of a knight using backtracking until it finds a valid path that covers the entire board.  
It was developed as part of a programming class exercise.
